# Notable-Projects
This repository contains some notable projects that I have worked on while learning coding in different languages. 
WordProbs.py
WordProbs,py is a python program written to read data from files containing data from dimensional analysis and transcripts that the analysis was performed on. 
Using this data, this program computes the p-values for each word occuring within the certain frame of analysis to see if they are more significant. 
PitchAnalysis.m
This code is my first MATLAB code that utilized the audio toolbox to extract pitch in real time and plot it so the user can see it. 
In addition, whenever a region of low pitch is found with certain conditions, the program will produce a backchannel repsonse.
